Hi sir, and welcome to my online resume.

First of all, sorry for being late: I submitted my resume with more than 24 hours delay, which I assume will cost me 2 points, as mentionned. 
I have a lot of work these days (PPE, ECE International, Freelance webmastering missions) and I couldn't finish before.

== LIVE DEMO ==
You can check out my resume here for live demo purposes:
https://thejals.com/~thejals/HTML5-TP1/
Hosted on my dedicated server 

== ADDITIONAL FILES ==
Concerning the additional files: these are images used for layout and illustration purposes.
I kept the 4 minimum required files (including profile.jpg) in the root folder and added all the additional images to the img/ one.

== JAVASCRIPT ==
Concerning the Javascript features: all the education and professional experience timeline both feature mouseover events with an illustration 
picture. There's a feature allowing to add a timeline event (in the professional experience section) that I chose to enable onkeyup and onkeydown
instead than onsubmit, which allows the user to view his event being added to the page as he is writing its content.

Concerning the email, I actually used ajax and mailgun PHP API to send emails using my domain: thejals.com, but as I didn't know if we were allowed
to submit you PHP files, I removed this feature for the campus submission version. 
The form is then useless but can be displayed by clicking "Send me one" next to my email in the contact session.

== W3C VALIDATION == 
At this time, and right before submission on campus, the resume is valid according to W3C for both CSS and HTML.
There's no error and no warning for the HTML and the CSS. 
CSS warnings can be found while inspecting the index.html instead of the .css page: it's due to the fontawesome imported css file, not mine.

== DESIGN ==
I wanted the design to be simple, with clear and dark blue patterns matching my website actual design: https://thejals.com
